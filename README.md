### Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Louis!

I'm a Computer Science student, with a passion for Software Engineering.

Some of my recent projects include:
- Building a [Java simulation platform](trust-sim) for simulating & evaluating computational models of Trust.
- Launching an iOS App, that lets you track the environmental impact of the Food & Drink you consume.
- Designing a 2-player chess game, that runs in the Terminal or can be integrated into other C++ applications.
- Designing decision tree and neural network classifiers for detecting the Higgs Boson in Particle Physics datasets.
