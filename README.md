### Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Louis!

Some of my recent projects include:
- Building a [Java simulation platform](https://github.com/louisheery/trust-sim) for simulating & evaluating computational models of Trust.
- Launching an [iOS App](https://github.com/louisheery/what-the-impact-ios), that lets you track the environmental impact of the Food & Drink you consume.
- Designing a [2-player chess game](https://github.com/louisheery/chess-game), that runs in the Terminal or can be integrated into other C++ applications.
- Designing [decision tree and neural network classifiers](https://github.com/louisheery/Higgs-ML) for detecting the Higgs Boson in Particle Physics datasets.
